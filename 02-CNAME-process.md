To add a CNAME:

I logged in to DirectNIC and at top there are dropdowns.
I hovered over the "My Services" tab and clicked on "Domains"
On the next web page, it showed all registered domains and I clicked on sunshinebrass.com
On the next web page, in the Services window I clicked the "manage" button next to DNS.
From there I was able to add the new name. In the field below I entered the name of my load balancer which is
